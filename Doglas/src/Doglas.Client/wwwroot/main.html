            I'm a software developer by profession but I also enjoy working on personal programming projects. Please check out some of the projects I've worked
            on! Outside of programming I like ski, play soccer, and climb. I also enjoy photography and getting out into nature.

          <p>Fri, Aug 2nd - Doug's Place - High Dive</p>
          <br />
          <p>
              It's BirthDoug time. I turn 29 at the end of July. I don't love getting older, but, we have to respect it. Let's respect it with a party.
              Vibe will be a pre-game before going out.

              Plan is anyone can come over Friday evening after 6:30 PM and optionally can catch
              <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/highdive/events/dang-a-soulful-electronic-dance-night-107625">
                  DANG! A Soulful Electronic Dance Night @ High Dive
              </a>
              . I'm the kind of person that did my comp sci projects early so you can actually come @ 6:30, I'll be ready. High Dive thing is 9:30PM-2AM.
              I'd get a $10 ticket because who knows when we get there.
              They have a nice
              <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4FF7tf0TWLChtgVD7cEiPg?si=5eb26907dc70437e">
                  spotify preview playlist
              </a>
              . Due to the previous bouncing during Dougwarming, we will now be strictly monitoring road beers.

              Feel free to bring some alcohol or snacks. Can always ask me what's needed. Message me for my address if you don't already have it!
